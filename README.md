# Forgive-me
A digital apology crafted with code and heart
#  I’m Sorry

## 🌪️ What I Did
I messed up. I hurt someone I care about deeply—and that someone is u.  
Whether it was thoughtless words, silence when you needed support, or just not showing up the way I should have... I regret it all.

## 🧠 What I’ve Realized
Love isn’t just about the good days.  
It’s about being there when things go wrong.  
It’s about listening, learning, and growing—even when it’s uncomfortable.  
And I’ve realized how much you mean to me, because this silence hurts more than anything.

## 💡 What I’ll Do Better
- I’ll communicate with care.
- I’ll listen without defensiveness.
- I’ll choose kindness over pride.
- I’ll never let you feel alone in this again.
